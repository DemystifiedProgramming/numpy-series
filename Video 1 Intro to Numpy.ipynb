    "        <p>Numpy is a third-party Python library written in C and used for various applications in mathematics and science. They are used in matrix operations, building intelligent machine-learning systems, statistical analyses, probabilistic and random simulations, and many others that one could research. They are far superior than using Python lists for large array operations because Numpy is optimized to perform much quicker than a bunch of Python for loops iterating through lists.</p>\n",
